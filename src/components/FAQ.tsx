    question: "What is the investment strategy and edge?",
    answer: "Laminar's edge lies in a diverse, adaptive trading framework: Intraday Trading exploits short-term price movements for frequent, nimble gains. Swing Trading captures medium-term trends over several days or weeks. Options Trading adds convexity to the portfolio through volatility-driven setups and strategic hedging. Delta-Neutral Strategies are designed to reduce directional exposure and monetize market inefficiencies using a mix of spot, futures, and options. This multi-layered strategy stack allows Laminar to generate returns in both bullish and bearish markets. Our operational advantage comes from a proprietary low-latency trading terminal built for advanced discretionary trading, priority access to premium exchange data feeds not available to most market participants, and five years of refinement in order flow analytics and derivatives modeling, enabling smarter trade positioning and superior edge retention."
